## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Haomin Li.

I received the B.S. degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2022.

Now I am chasing my PhD degree in computer science in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Intelligent Memory & Processor Architecture & Computing Lab (IMPACT Lab), under the supervision of Prof. [Li Jiang](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/) and Assist Prof. [Fangxin Liu](https://mxhx7199.github.io/).

My current research interests focus on Hardware-software Co-Design for Efficient and Secure AI.

Hardware: (CIM-based) ASIC Design, Edge FPGAs, and Edge/Server GPUs.

Software: Brain-Inspired Neuromorphic Computing, LLMs/Neural Networks, 3D Perception and Generation, and Secure AI Workloads.
